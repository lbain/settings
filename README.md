# Settings

A backup of personal settings - for when I next need to get started on a new computer.

## Steps
1. Keep this directory in Dropbox
2. Setup Dropbox on your new computer (or just clone this repo to a `~/Dropbox` directory)
3. Run `chmod +x ~/Dropbox/setup.command
4. Double click on the `setup` file

This will symlink the `.bash_profile` correctly and list the remaining programs to install.
